## A game made for GitHub's GameOff2021

Little Trouble is a 2D platformer made with new and original pixel art assets and code.

Explore the world you know from a different perspective -- how would a bug-sized person utilize their surroundings? Find items and maneuver around this little world in search of a new friend and a new home.

The game takes inspiration from many metroidvania video games, introducing powerups that the character gains throughout the level.

The platformer follows the theme of "bug" and was completed within a month!
